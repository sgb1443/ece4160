        <h1>Lab 1B: Bluetooth Communication with Artemis</h1>
        
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The goal of Lab 1B was to establish Bluetooth communication between my computer and the Artemis board. I used Python in Jupyter notebooks to send commands to the Artemis board, which was running Arduino code. I also set up communication from the Artemis back to my computer and the Python script. This communication was made easier through the use of notifiers. The ability of the Artemis to send data back to the computer via Bluetooth will be useful in future projects.</p>

        <h2>Prelab: Setup and Codebase</h2>
        
        <h3>Computer Setup</h3>
        <p>To begin the lab, I ensured that I had the latest version of Python installed (Python 3.10 or later) and verified that pip was also up-to-date. The first task was to install the required packages and set up a virtual environment to isolate my lab dependencies from the rest of the system.</p>
        
        <h4>Install Virtual Environment</h4>
        <p>I installed <code>virtualenv</code> with the command:</p>
        <pre><code>python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv</code></pre>
        
        <h4>Create and Activate the Virtual Environment</h4>
        <p>I created a new directory for my lab project and created a virtual environment:</p>
        <pre><code>python3 -m venv FastRobots_ble</code></pre>
        <p>I activated the environment with:</p>
        <pre><code>> .\FastRobots_ble\Scripts\activate</code></pre>

          <h4>Virtual Environment Setup through Command Prompt:</h4>

        <h4>Install Necessary Packages</h4>
        <p>After activating the environment, I installed the necessary Python packages for the lab using the following command:</p>
        <pre><code>pip install numpy pyyaml colorama nest_asyncio bleak jupyterlab</code></pre>
        
        <h3>Codebase</h3>
        <p>Once the environment was set up, I downloaded and unzipped the codebase into my project directory. This included several important files for both the Artemis board (<code>ble_arduino.ino</code>) and the Python side of things (<code>ble.py</code>, <code>base_ble.py</code>, etc.). To use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication, I read through the provided <code>demo.ipynb</code> notebook to familiarize myself with how the code is structured and the functions I would use.</p>

        <h2>Artemis Board Setup</h2>
        <p>On the Artemis side, I first installed the <code>ArduinoBLE</code> library through the Arduino IDE’s library manager. Then, I loaded the <code>ble_arduino.ino</code> sketch onto the Artemis board. It was important to set the baud rate to 9600 bps, which would allow for the communication between the computer and the Artemis board without crashing my computer.</p>
        <p>The Artemis board printed its MAC address, which I later used to update the <code>connections.yaml</code> file on the computer side to ensure the correct pairing.</p>

        <h2>Lab Tasks</h2>

        <h3>1. Sending a String Value to the Artemis Board</h3>
        <p>The first task involved sending a string from my computer to the Artemis board using the <strong>ECHO</strong> command. I sent the string “hi” to the Artemis, and the board responded by sending the augmented string “Artemis says hi” back to the Jupyter notebook.</p>

           <h4>Echo Code Output:</h4>

        <h3>2. Sending Three Floats to the Artemis Board</h3>
        <p>For the next step, I used the <strong>SEND_THREE_FLOATS</strong> command to send three float values from the computer to the Artemis board. These values were then displayed on the serial monitor of the Arduino sketch running on the Artemis board. This demonstrated the Artemis's ability to handle multiple float values simultaneously. I sent <strong>2.25</strong>, <strong>6.10</strong>, and <strong>3.07</strong>; all of which the board returned.</p>

        <h3>3. Adding GET_TIME_MILLIS Command</h3>
        <p>I then added a new command, <strong>GET_TIME_MILLIS</strong>, to the Artemis board. The Jupyter notebook requested the time from the Artemis, and the Artemis sent back the time it had been running for in the format <code>T: milliseconds</code> and displayed <code>Sent time</code> on the serial monitor.</p>

        <h3>4. Setting Up Notification Handler in Python</h3>
        <p>I set up a <strong>notification handler</strong> in Python to receive the time string from the Artemis board. The handler processed the string (e.g., <code>T:123456</code>) and extracted the time value from it. This step allowed for less code needed to obtain a value. In task 3, it takes four lines to extract a value, while in task 4, it only takes two once the notifier is set up.</p>

         <h4>Using the Notifier:</h4>

        <h3>5. Measuring Data Transfer Rate</h3>
        <p>Next, I wrote a loop that continuously requested the current time from the Artemis board in milliseconds. The timestamps were sent from the Artemis to my computer and processed by the notification handler. I collected these timestamps for a few seconds and calculated how fast the messages were being sent by having the Arduino code label the number of each data value sent. This helped me determine the effective data transfer rate of the system when calling for data from Artemis to Jupyter notebook. <strong>134 data points</strong> were sent in <strong>7.2 seconds</strong>, for a rate of a data point every <strong>0.0186 milliseconds</strong>.</p>

            <img src="5arduino.png" alt="Screenshot showing virtual environment setup in command prompt" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">
         <h4>Calling in Jupyter Notebook:</h4>
            <img src="task5python.png" alt="Screenshot showing virtual environment setup in command prompt" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">

            <img src="5reading.png" alt="Screenshot showing virtual environment setup in command prompt" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">
        
        <h3>6. Storing Time Stamps in an Array</h3>
        <p>Next, instead of sending each timestamp individually, I stored them in an array. I made the size of the array to be 
            <strong>5,000</strong> and had the code alert me when the array filled. This shows how over 5,000 data points were obtained using this method vs the prior 134. I also created a <strong>SEND_TIME_DATA</strong> 
            command that loops through the array and sends each data point back to the computer for processing. This allowed me to 
            gather and then send all of the data to Jupyter notebook.</p>

         <h4>Array Full:</h4>
            <img src="6full.png" alt="Screenshot showing virtual environment setup in command prompt" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">

       <h3>7. Adding Temperature Readings to the Array</h3>
        <p>I then added a second array to store temperature readings, ensuring that each temperature reading corresponded to the 
        timestamp at which it was recorded. The <strong>GET_TEMP_READINGS</strong> command was used to loop through both arrays (time and temperature), 
        sending the data concurrently to the computer. The notification handler processed the data, displaying the time and temperature values 
        in side-by-sie lists.</p>

          <h3>8. Discussion of Methods</h3>
              <p> In the first method, data is transmitted immediately as it is received, providing real-time communication, whereas the second method collects the data over a specific time period before quickly sending it all at once. The second method allows for faster data transfer. Upon reviewing the output from the second method, it was evident that several timestamps had identical values, suggesting that multiple data points were sent by the Artemis within a single millisecond.

The primary advantage of the first method is its ability to provide live data, but it is slower because it relies on waiting for new sensor data. On the other hand, the second method enables much faster transmission but sacrifices real-time communication. This can be an issue if the robot moves quickly, as the data sent may reflect the robot’s previous location rather than its current one. Furthermore, since data is stored on the Artemis, there’s a risk of exceeding the storage capacity. The first method is ideal for scenarios requiring live updates or troubleshooting, while the second method is more suited for recording data during a specific event or experiment for later review.

The Artemis board has a storage capacity of 384KB (384,000 bytes). Since each time and temperature value is stored as a 4-byte float, the board can store up to 96,000 time values at most.    </p>
