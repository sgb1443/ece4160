        <h1>Orientation PID Control</h1>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p> The goal of this lab was to gain hands-on experience with orientation PID control using the IMU. While Lab 5 
            focused on PID control for wall distance with TOF sensors, this lab focused on controlling the robot’s yaw based on IMU data.
</p>
        <h2>Prelab</h2>

         <h3>Settig up the DMP:</h3>
            <img src="DMP.png" alt="" style="width: 600px; height: auto;">
      <p>Digital integration of gyro data can lead to drift over time, as small errors and noise accumulate, 
          causing the estimated orientation to slowly become inaccurate as seen in prior labs. To reduce yaw drift, I used the onboard digital 
          motion processor (DMP) in the IMU, which fuses gyro and accelerometer
          data internally and provides orientation estimates with much lower drift. Using the DMP significantly helped maintain a stable yaw reading.
          I turned on the DMP in the setup code, ran the examples, and then integrated the example code with my ble code to get a yaw reading that I then used 
          in my control loop. 
</p>
             <h3>Handling Data:</h3>
            <img src="data.png" alt="Screenshot showing virtual environment setup in command prompt" style="width: 600px; height: auto;">
      <p>I created arrays to store the data points. I created a command to pull the data to python once I turned off the PID loop. I sent data point #, 
        milliseconds, PWM, and Yaw reading to python to aid in debugging and allow me to graph my data. 
</p>
        <h3>Setting up PID: </h3>
        <p>I created a few different sections of code to allow PID to run smoothly on my car. </p>

 <p>         1-Like Lab 5, I added a command that allows you to change your PID values on the spot. While testing PID, 
          it was very annoying to have to wait a few minutes for the code to compile each time I wanted to change PID 
          values. This made testing a lot easier. 
</p>

       <img src="orientset.png" alt="." style="width: 600px; height: auto;">

      <p>        2- Add a command to start and stop Orientation PID from python. 

</p>
       <img src="on.png" alt="." style="width: 600px; height: auto;">

       <p>        3- Inside the void loop (), place code that checks to see if PID is turned on. If so, run the PID loop. 
</p>

        <p>       4- The Orient PID loop calculates current Yaw values using the DMP, updates arrays, and calls the command to calculate a new PWM. The current Yaw is determined, 
            send to PID calculations, then a PWM is returned. From this PWM, the 
          correct move (either left or right, and how fast) command is called. I tested my motors to see which combination of on made them turn each way, as is seen below. 
</p>
       <img src="turn.png" alt="." style="width: 600px; height: auto;">

          <p>       5- The PID Calculations function is where I send the current yaw and target distance to get back a PWM from the Orientation PID loop. 
              

</p>

          <p>        6. On the python side, I call ble.send_command(CMD.ORIENTPIDCONTROL, ".15|.4|1") to set my values, ble.send_command(CMD.ORIENTPIDCONTROLON, "1") to start PID, and 
            ble.send_command(CMD.ORIENTPIDCONTROLON, "0") to turn off PID. I use a notification handler to process my array and call ble.send_command(CMD.ORIENTTRANSFER, "") to get my data.  
</p>


      
        <h2>Lab Tasks</h2>
        <h3>The P controller: </h3>
         <h4>My P loop: </h4>
        <img src="loop.png" alt="." style="width: 600px; height: auto;">

        <p>     I started off by writing a P controller. I then tested a range of values for Kp. If Kp was too large, the car would 
            overshoot and keep spinning. If Kp was too small, I found the car would get stuck and not
            be able to get to the target yaw as the PWMs from the P loop would be too small for the car to move. 
            
           I set my min 
            PWM to 50 and the max to 150 like in lab 5, as I found that letting the car go up to 250 caused it to respond more unpredictably. Limiting the max PWM to 
            150 saw little decrease in the time needed to get to the Yaw goal and many times more predictability, so this parameter was worthwhile in improving overall performance. I 
            found my optimal Kp value to be 2. Here, the car wouldn't massivley overshoot and keep turning 
            and wouldn't get stuck with too little PWM input. Too much Kp (=3) caused the car to bounce back and forth around the target distance. 

</p>
        

        <h4>Graphs, Kp= 1 vs Kp=2 vs Kp = 3: </h4>
         <img src="1c.png" alt="." style="width: 800px; height: auto;">
         <p>   Here, the Kp is too low as the car settles at a spot where it's wheels don't have enough PWM to cause it to turn to the target yaw.  

</p>
         <img src="3b.png" alt="." style="width: 800px; height: auto;">
        <p>    This shows the car's oscillations around the target yaw as it overshoots and compensates. 

</p>
            <img src="2.png" alt="." style="width: 800px; height: auto;">
        <p>    This shows the car's oscillating a bit but then arriving at its target.  

</p>

        <h3>PI, PID?: </h3>
        <p>     I was able to get my P loop working reliably. Taking the derivative of a signal that is the integral of another signal 
            can make sense in theory because the derivative and integral are inverse operations. However, in practice, this can amplify noise and lead to instability. 
            The derivative term is very sensitive to sudden changes or small fluctuations, which can result in large spikes in the output. In this case, P control appeared to be suitable.
        </p>
 

 <h3>Discussion: </h3>
 <p>     This lab ran smoothly as I was able to repurpose a lot of code from lab 5. I'm excited to push the robot's PID capibilities in the future.
