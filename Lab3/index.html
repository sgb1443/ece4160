        <h1>TOF Lab Report</h1>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this lab is to equip the robot with distance sensors - the faster the robot can sample and the more it can trust a sensor reading, the faster it is able to drive.
</p>
        <h2>Prelab</h2>
        <h3>Setting up TOF</h3>
        <p>In this lab, we will set up a Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor, which is based on the VL53L1X. Each by default has the same address, 
            so I wired the X shut pin to the Artemis board on one TOF, allowing me to manually change the second sensor's address. This is 
            more efficient than continuously enable/disabling the two sensors separately as it allows for continuous data collection from both sensors. 
            In order to detect obstacles, I will place a TOF sensor on the front of the car and on the right side. There will be blindspots on the left 
            and in the back, however, this should be enough to allow the car to perform stunts. I used the longer wires to connect my TOF to the Arduino 
            since the Arduino will be placed closer to the back of the car. 
</p>

         <h2>Lab Tasks</h2>
        <h3>1. Attached a JST to a battery to power the Artemis </h3>
        <h4>Connected Battery:</h4>
            <img src="IMG_4441.png" alt="Screenshot showing virtual environment setup in command prompt" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">
         <h3>2. Setup TOF</h3>
        <p> Installed the SparkFun VL53L1X 4m laser distance sensor library and Connected the QWIIC break-out board to the Artemis, then 
            soldered QWIIC cables to each TOF sensor. I scanned the I2C channel to find the sensors. The first default address is in the i2c image above, and represents the 
            number 84 but bit shifted.  
            I set the distance mode of my sensors to short. The pros/cons of each mode is that it will be most accurate in the range it is set to. In this scenario, the car needs
            to know accurately what is right by it to navigate sucessfully, hence the choice of short mode.

            QWIIC wiring: Red= Vcc, Black = Ground, Blue= SDA, Yellow= SCL

 <h3>3. Test TOF</h3>
    <p>  I tested my chosen mode by setting up my TOF sensors and collected data at 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100cm. 
        I collected 100 data points for each measurement. I added code to the main ble script to take both sensor readings and send it to python. 
        In python, I calculated the average and standard deviation for each data point and created plots. </p>

         <h4>StDev vs Actual Distance Graph: </h4>
            <img src="stdevgraph.png" alt="Screenshot showing virtual environment setup in command prompt" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">
         <p> The acutal vs recorded distance are very similar. Further testing should be done to confirm if StDev increases with distance as one sensor shows an increase
             while the second does not. </p>

        <h3>4. Fast Loop</h3>

         <p> I sped up my loop used previously to be as fast as possible. I moved the start ranging out of the loop and took out all unecescary code.
             I was able to send 86 data points from Arduino to Bluetooth in 5 seconds. I added 
         an indicator to see if the TOF had new data yet. There was only a delay at the start, otherwise the TOF always had data ready. 
             Although the TOF sensor is 
             meant to read at a frequency of 50Hz, I am getting readings at 17Hz. The current limiting factor maybe the bluetooth communication. </p>

 <h3>Discussion </h3>
        <p> This lab made me more confidnet with integating sensors into my ble and python code. The TOF seems to be very accurate and I'm excited to see what all can be done
            with it's readings. <p/>
