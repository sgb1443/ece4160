<h1>Lab 12: Path Planning and Execution</h1>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>
    The goal of this lab was to demonstrate autonomous path execution by integrating robot motion control with pre-defined waypoint navigation. Building upon the functionality developed in previous labs, this final exercise aimed to create a complete system capable of reliably following a multi-point path across a mapped environment.
</p>

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
    My approach centered around writing BLE command functions in Python that could be easily edited, tuned, and executed without needing to re-upload code to the Artemis board. The strategy was intentionally simple: rely on <strong>open-loop timed control</strong> to move the robot forward or execute turns.
</p>
<p>
    Two basic commands were used:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>FORWARD_TIME_PWM</code>: Drive forward for a set time and PWM</li>
    <li><code>TURN_DIR_TIME</code>: Turn left (2) or right (1) for a set time and PWM</li>
</ul>
<p>
    A Python script generated a sequence of these commands based on the waypoint layout and calibrated timing. Each movement or turn was followed by a <code>time.sleep()</code> to ensure proper execution duration before the next command.
</p>

<h3>Execution Path</h3>
<p>The robot followed these waypoints:</p>
<pre>
(-4, -3) → (-2, -1) → (1, -1) → (2, -3) → (5, -3) 
       → (5, -2) → (5, 3) → (0, 3) → (0, 0)
</pre>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>
    I manually calibrated each segment by iterating trial runs, adjusting time durations based on battery levels and drift. I found that even the same command could behave differently across trials due to minor inconsistencies in power, so frequent re-tuning was necessary.
</p>

<h4>Sample Command Script:</h4>
<pre>
import time

ble.send_command(CMD.FORWARD_TIME_PWM, "580|150")  # (-4, -3) → (-2, -1)
time.sleep(0.580)

ble.send_command(CMD.TURN_DIR_TIME, "2|410|150")   # right turn
time.sleep(0.410)

ble.send_command(CMD.FORWARD_TIME_PWM, "700|150")  # (-2, -1) → (1, -1)
time.sleep(0.700)

ble.send_command(CMD.TURN_DIR_TIME, "2|450|150")   # right turn
time.sleep(0.450)
...
</pre>
<p>
    This control logic proved effective for quickly testing variations in path timing. All planning and command sequencing happened offboard on the host computer.
</p>

<h3>Performance and Observations</h3>
<p>
    The robot completed the full waypoint path reliably in multiple trials. While open-loop control lacks the precision of feedback-based methods, the combination of BLE command batching and time-based execution was sufficient to complete the task.
</p>
<p>
    The largest sources of error were due to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Battery degradation affecting PWM consistency</li>
    <li>Wheel slip causing slight drift over longer segments</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    This lab showcased a functional end-to-end navigation pipeline built from modular BLE commands. While feedback control could offer improved precision, my open-loop method was a fast, testable, and robust solution for waypoint navigation using calibrated motion segments.
